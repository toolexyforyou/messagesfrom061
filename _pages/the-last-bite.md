title: The last bite

She can act like it,  
like there are no signs  
that the steak has gone bad.

She can tell herself  
how good the steak looked  
when she first saw it  
on the laminated menu.

She can bring the steak back home,  
to sit on her kitchen counter,  
inside its crappy styrofoam packaging.

She can gawk at  
what advertised itself as  
“the juiciest steak on the menu”  
rot from the inside out.

She can “give it space” and “give it time”  
and give, give, give,  
until there’s nothing left to give.

She can act like it,  
but deep down,  
I know she knows,  
she just doesn’t fucking want to eat the steak.
