    <h2>I want to be somebody to you</h2>
    <p>I wonder if you still feel me<br>
    in moments that flash by.<br>
    Not always, not often—just some of the time.</p>
    <p>I wonder if you still see me dance in your cars,<br>
    or hear me talk louder at your bars,<br>
    or taste me on your pricey cigars.</p>
    <p>Weeks, or months, or years flash by,<br>
    but I still feel you—<br>
    at least some of the time.</p>
    <p>I guess,<br>
    even if it’s only momentary,<br>
    I’d hate to feel that fucking temporary.</p>
