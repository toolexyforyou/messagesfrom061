    <h2>I want to be somebody to you</h2>
    <p>
        I wonder if you still feel me<br>
        in moments that flash by.<br>
        Not always, not often—just some of the time.
    </p>
    <p>
        I wonder if you still see me dance in your cars,<br>
        or hear me talk louder at your bars,<br>
        or taste me on your pricey cigars.
    </p>
    <p>
        Weeks, or months, or years flash by,<br>
        but I still feel you—<br>
        at least some of the time.
    </p>
    <p>
        I guess,<br>
        even if it’s only momentary,<br>
        I’d hate to feel that fucking temporary.
    </p>
