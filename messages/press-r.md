# Press R

I hate you,
I hate you not,
I hate you,
I hate you not.

But when it hits me
three months later,
hearing ding
outside the elevator,

that those dull
silver walls
could close in
on me again.

I’ll be back in
fight or flight,
frantically pressing R
on the panel.

Only to book it 
to a party
filled with people
I haven’t met:

thinking,
“I’ll always land
on hating you,
because how could I forget?”
