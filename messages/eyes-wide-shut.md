# Eyes wide shut

I want you to know
it didn’t start 
in that doctor’s office:

with her eyes wide shut,
her pupils blackened,
and her eyebrows raised up.

It started at the blinding 
casino entrance,
where she was shit out of luck.

It started on the glittery 
blackjack table,
where she spent her last buck.

It started in the dingy 
parking lot,
where she dozed off in his truck.

But it didn’t start 
when her back slid down
the coldest vinyl couch.
