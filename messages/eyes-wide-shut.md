# Eyes wide shut

I want you to know  
it didn’t start  
in that doctor’s office.

With her eyes wide shut,  
her pupils blackened,  
and her eyebrows raised up.

It actually started  
at the casino entrance,  
where she was shit out of luck.

It started  
on the blackjack table,  
where she spent her last buck.

It started  
in the parking lot,  
where she dozed off in his truck.

But it didn’t start  
in that doctor’s office  
when her back slid down the cold vinyl couch.
