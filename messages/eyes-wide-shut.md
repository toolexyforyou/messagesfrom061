# Eyes wide shut

It didn’t start in that doctor’s office:
with her eyes wide shut,
her pupils blackened,
and her eyebrows raised up.

It started at the
blinding casino entrance,
where she was 
shit out of luck.

It started on the 
glittery blackjack table,
where she spent 
her last buck.

It started in the 
dingy parking lot,
where she dozed off 
in his truck.

But I just want you to know 
it didn’t start in that doctor’s office
when her back slid down
the cold vinyl couch.
