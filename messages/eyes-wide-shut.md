# Eyes wide shut

I want you to know
it didn’t start 
at the doctor's office:

with her eyes wide shut, 
her pupils blackened,
and her eyebrows raised up.

It started at the 
dazzling entrance,
where she was shit out of luck.

It started on the  
dirty blackjack table,
where she spent her last buck.

It started in the 
dingy parking lot,
where she dozed off in his truck.

But it didn’t start 
at the doctor’s office
when her back hit the cold vinyl couch.
