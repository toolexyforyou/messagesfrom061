# I want to be somebody to you

I wonder if you still feel me  
in moments that flash by.  
Not always, not often,  
just some of the time.

I wonder if you see me dance in your cars,  
or if you hear me talk louder at your bars,  
or if you taste me on your pricey cigars.

Weeks,  
or months,  
or years  
flash by.

But I still feel you,  
at least,  
some of the time.

I guess, even if  
it’s only momentary,  
I’d hate to feel that  
fucking temporary.
