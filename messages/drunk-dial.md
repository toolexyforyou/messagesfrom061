# Drunk dial

I hate it when I hit your line
asking, “Do you still 
feel me, at least, some of the time?”

But, “Do you 
still see me 
dance in your cars?”

Like, “Do you 
still hear me 
talk louder at your bars?”

No, “Do you 
still taste me 
on your pricey cigars?”

I know it’s only momentary
but I’d hate to feel 
that fucking temporary.
