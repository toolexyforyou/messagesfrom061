# Not Guilty

She stumbled 
straight into the bathroom 
of the trashiest bar 
in town,

running faster than 
the jet-black mascara
gushing out
her lashes.

I booked it 
to the corner 
where she crashed 
right into that leaking faucet.

She cried, 
“I’m sick and tired 
of fucking up every 
good thing that I’ve got.”

But I didn’t never—
I wouldn’t ever—
force her
to repent

when 
I wasn’t the judge, 
and I wasn’t the jury,
and I wasn’t the executioner either.
