# Not Guilty

She stumbled right 
into the bathroom 
of the trashiest 
bar in town,

running faster than 
the jet-black mascara
gushing out 
of her lashes.

I rushed to the corner
where she crashed
straight into that 
leaking faucet.

She cried, 
“I’m sick and tired 
of fucking up  
every good thing that I’ve got.”

But I didn’t never—
I wouldn’t ever—
force her 
to repent.

When I wasn’t a judge, 
and I wasn’t a jury,
and I wasn’t an executioner 
either.
