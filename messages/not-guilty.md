# Not guilty

She stumbled straight 
into the bathroom 
of the trashiest 
bar in town,

running faster than 
the jet-black mascara
gushing out of her lashes.

I rushed to her stall, 
where she started to bawl,
“I fuck everything up, 
it’s all my damn fault.”

But I didn’t never,
I wouldn’t ever,
force her to repent.

When I wasn’t a judge, 
and I wasn’t a jury,
and I wasn’t an executioner 
either.
