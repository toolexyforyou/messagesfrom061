# Strawberry daiquiri

You shot me that text
on a Monday late night,
so I swore you had to be joking.

But we sped to the pub
in a beat-up black cab,
only stopping to get a quick smoke in.

You leaned over
the worn-out bar,
where the neon sign blinked,

to say,
“She’ll have a daiquiri,”
knowing my favorite drink.

So I dove headfirst
into the glass
of sweetness on my tongue.

Before you kissed it off
at closing time to the sound 
of the track: “I’m Sprung”.
