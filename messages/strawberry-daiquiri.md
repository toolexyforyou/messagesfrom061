# Strawberry daiquiri

You shot me that text
on a Monday late night,
so I swore you had to be joking.

But we sped to the pub,
in a beat-up black cab,
only stopping to get a quick smoke in.

You leaned over the worn-out bar,
where I got lost in 
the neon sign's blinking,

to say, 
“She’ll have a daiquiri,”
knowing my favorite glass to be drinking.

I dove head first 
into the glass 
of strawberry sweetness on my tongue

before you kissed it off 
at closing time
to the sound of the track, “I’m Sprung”.
