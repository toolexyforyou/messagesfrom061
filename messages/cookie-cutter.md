# Cookie cutter

She was 
a perfectionist,
who wore perfectionism
as a badge of honor,

cutting
her errors
out
like paper dolls.

The realization 
slapped her across the face:
“perfect”doesn’t even exist
but done does.

So she throws
out
those blunt
scissors,

leaving the edges jagged,
to beam
at her
crooked paper dolls.
