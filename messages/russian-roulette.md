# Russian roulette

Go ahead, pull the trigger,
why put up a fight?
When you can be another “you deserve better”
by the end of the night.

Tell me pretty white lies
about how you only have eyes for me.
Tell me pretty white lies
about how you never tasted nothing so sweet.

But the shot still rings out 
at the end of the night.
So go ahead, babe, disappoint me
because you do it just right.
