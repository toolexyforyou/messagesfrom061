# Russian roulette

Go ahead, 
pull the trigger,
why put up a fight?

When you can be another 
“you deserve better”
by the end of the night.

Tell me pretty white lies.
Lies like, "I can feel the heat."
Lies like, "I never, ever tasted nothing so sweet."

When your bullet flies out,
it's my teeth 
that I'll bite,

saying, "Go ahead, babe, 
disappoint me,"
because your aim is just right.
